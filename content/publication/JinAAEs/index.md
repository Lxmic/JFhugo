abstract: In response to changing environments, plants regulate gene expression and
  subsequent metabolism to acclimate and survive. A superfamily of acyl-activating
  enzymes (AAEs) has been observed in every class of creatures on planet. Some of
  plant AAE genes have been identified and functionally characterized to be involved
  in growth, development, biotic, and abiotic stresses via mediating diverse metabolic
  pathways. However, less information is available about AAEs superfamily in tomato
  (Solanum lycopersicum), the highest value fruit and vegetable crop globally. In
  this study, we aimed to identify tomato AAEs superfamily and investigate potential
  functions with respect to aluminum (Al) stress that represents one of the major
  factors limiting crop productivity on acid soils worldwide. Fifty-three AAE genes
  of tomato were identified and named on the basis of phylogenetic relationships between
  Arabidopsis and tomato. The phylogenetic analysis showed that AAEs could be classified
  into six clades; however, clade III contains no AAE genes of tomato. Synteny analyses
  revealed tomato vegetable paralogs and Arabidopsis orthologs. The RNA-seq and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that 9 out of 53 AAEs genes
  were significantly up- or downregulated by Al stress. Numerous cis-acting elements
  implicated in biotic and abiotic stresses were detected in the promoter regions
  of SlAAEs. As the most abundantly expressed gene in root apex and highly induced
  by Al, there are many potential STOP1 cis-acting elements present in the promoter
  of SlAAE3-1, and its expression in root apex was specific to Al. Finally, transgenic
  tobacco lines overexpressing SlAAE3-1 displayed increased tolerance to Al. Altogether,
  our results pave the way for further studies on the functional characterization
  of SlAAE genes in tomato with a wish of improvement in tomato crop in the future.
