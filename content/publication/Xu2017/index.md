abstract: Relying on Al-activated root oxalate secretion, and internal detoxification
  and accumulation of Al, buckwheat is highly Al resistant. However, the molecular
  mechanisms responsible for these processes are still poorly understood. It is wellknown
  that root apex is the critical region of Al toxicity that rapidly impairs a series
  of events, thus, resulting in inhibition of root elongation. Here, we carried out
  transcriptome analysis of the buckwheat root apex (0â€“1 cm) with regards to early
  response (first 6 h) to Al stress (20 textmuM), which is crucial for identification
  of both genes and processes involved in Al toxicity and tolerance mechanisms. We
  obtained 34,469 unigenes with 26,664 unigenes annotated in the NCBI database, and
  identified 589 up-regulated and 255 down-regulated differentially expressed genes
  (DEGs) under Al stress. Functional category analysis revealed that biological processes
  differ between up- and downregulated genes, although `metabolic processes' were
  the most affected category in both up- and down-regulated DEGs. Based on the data,
  it is proposed that Al stress affects a variety of biological processes that collectively
  contributes to the inhibition of root elongation. We identified 30 transporter genes
  and 27 transcription factor (TF) genes induced by Al. Gene homology analysis highlighted
  candidate genes encoding transporters associated with Al uptake, transport, detoxification,
  and accumulation. We also found that TFs play critical role in transcriptional regulation
  of Al resistance genes in buckwheat. In addition, gene duplication events are very
  common in the buckwheat genome, suggesting a possible role for gene duplication
  in the species' high Al resistance. Taken together, the transcriptomic analysis
  of buckwheat root apex shed light on the processes that contribute to the inhibition
  of root elongation. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis of both transporter
  genes and TF genes not only deep our understanding on the responses of buckwheat
  roots to Al toxicity but provide a good start for functional characterization of
  genes critical for Al tolerance.
