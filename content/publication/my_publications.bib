  abstract = {SUMMARY                            Formate dehydrogenase (FDH; EC 1.2.1.2.) has been implicated in plant responses to a variety of stresses, including aluminum (Al) stress in acidic soils. However, the role of this enzyme in Al tolerance is not yet fully understood, and how               FDH               gene expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of the tomato (               Solanum lycopersicum               )               SlFDH               gene.               SlFDH               encodes a mitochondria-localized FDH with               K               m               values of 2.087~m               m               formate and 29.1~{$\mu$}               m               NAD               +               . Al induced the expression of               SlFDH               in tomato root tips, but other metals did not, as determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. CRISPR/Cas9-generated               SlFDH               knockout lines were more sensitive to Al stress and formate than wild-type plants. Formate failed to induce               SlFDH               expression in the tomato root apex, but NAD               +               accumulated in response to Al stress. Co-expression network analysis and interaction analysis between genomic DNA and transcription factors (TFs) using PlantRegMap identified seven TFs that might regulate               SlFDH               expression. One of these TFs, SlSTOP1, positively regulated               SlFDH               expression by directly binding to its promoter, as demonstrated by a dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The Al-induced expression of               SlFDH               was completely abolished in               Slstop1               mutants, indicating that SlSTOP1 is a core regulator of               SlFDH               expression under Al stress. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that SlFDH plays a role in Al tolerance and reveal the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of               SlFDH               expression in response to Al stress in tomato.                        ,              Significance Statement                            Formate dehydrogenase (FDH; EC 1.2.1.2.) catalyzes the degradation of formate and the reduction of NAD               +               to NADH. Here, we demonstrate that the FDH gene               SlFDH               is induced by aluminum stress in tomato, which relies on the transcription factor SlSTOP1, to enhance tolerance to aluminum stress via SlFDH-catalyzed reduction of NAD               +               .},
