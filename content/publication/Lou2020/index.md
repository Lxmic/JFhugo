abstract: Transcriptional regulation is important for plants to respond to toxic effects
  of aluminium (Al). However, our current knowledge to these events is confined to
  a few transcription factors. Here, we functionally characterized a rice bean (Vigna
  umbellata) NAC-type transcription factor, VuNAR1, in terms of Al stress response.
  We demonstrated that rice bean VuNAR1 is a nuclear-localized transcriptional activator,
  whose expression was specifically upregulated by Al in roots but not in shoot. VuNAR1
  overexpressing Arabidopsis plants exhibit improved Al resistance via Al exclusion.
  However, VuNAR1-mediated Al exclusion is independent of the function of known Al-resistant
  genes. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that VuNAR1 specifically regulates
  the expression of genes associated with protein phosphorylation and cell wall modification
  in Arabidopsis. Transient expression assay demonstrated the direct transcriptional
  activation of cell wall-associated receptor kinase 1 (WAK1) by VuNAR1. Moreover,
  yeast one-hybrid assays and MEME motif searches identified a new VuNAR1-specific
  binding motif in the promoter of WAK1. Compared with wild-type Arabidopsis plants,
  VuNAR1 overexpressing plants have higher WAK1 expression and less pectin content.
  Taken together, our results suggest that VuNAR1 regulates Al resistance by regulating
  cell wall pectin metabolism via directly binding to the promoter of WAK1 and induce
  its expression.
