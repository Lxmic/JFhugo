abstract: 'Background: The family of NAC proteins (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) represent
  a class of large plant-specific transcription factors. However, identification and
  functional surveys of NAC genes of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) remain unstudied,
  despite the tomato genome being decoded for several years. This study aims to identify
  the NAC gene family and investigate their potential roles in responding to Al stress.
  Results: Ninety-three NAC genes were identified and named in accordance with their
  chromosome location. Phylogenetic analysis found SlNACs are broadly distributed
  in 5 groups. Gene expression analysis showed that SlNACs had different expression
  levels in various tissues and at different fruit development stages. Cycloheximide
  treatment and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that SlNACs may aid regulation of tomato
  in response to Al stress, 19 of which were significantly up- or down-regulated in
  roots of tomato following Al stress. Conclusion: This work establishes a knowledge
  base for further studies on biological functions of SlNACs in tomato and will aid
  in improving agricultural traits of tomato in the future.'
