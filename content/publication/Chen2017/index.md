abstract: Being an Al-accumulating crop, buckwheat detoxifies and tolerates Al not
  only in roots but also in leaves. While much progress has recently been made toward
  Al toxicity and resistance mechanisms in roots, little is known about the molecular
  basis responsible for detoxification and tolerance processes in leaves. Here, we
  carried out transcriptome analysis of buckwheat leaves in response to Al stress
  (20 textmuM, 24 h). We obtained 33,931 unigenes with 26,300 unigenes annotated in
  the NCBI database, and identified 1063 upregulated and 944 downregulated genes under
  Al stress. Functional category analysis revealed that genes related to protein translation,
  processing, degradation and metabolism comprised the biological processes most affected
  by Al, suggesting that buckwheat leaves maintain flexibility under Al stress by
  rapidly reprogramming their physiology and metabolism. Analysis of genes related
  to transcription regulation revealed that a large proportion of chromatin-regulation
  genes are specifically downregulated by Al stress, whereas transcription factor
  genes are overwhelmingly upregulated. Furthermore, we identified 78 upregulated
  and 22 downregulated genes that encode transporters. Intriguingly, only a few genes
  were overlapped with root Al-regulated transporter genes, which include homologs
  of AtMATE, ALS1, STAR1, ALS3 and a divalent ion symporter. In addition, we identified
  a subset of genes involved in development, in which genes associated with flowering
  regulation were important. Based on these data, it is proposed that buckwheat leaves
  develop conserved and distinct mechanisms to cope with Al toxicity.
