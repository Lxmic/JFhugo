abstract: Low phosphate (Pi) availability and high aluminum (Al) toxicity constitute
  two major plant mineral nutritional stressors that limit plant productivity on acidic
  soils. Advances toward the identification of genes and signaling networks that are
  involved in both stresses in model plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and rice
  (Oryza sativa), and in other plants as well have revealed that some factors such
  as organic acids (OAs), cell wall properties, phytohormones, and iron (Fe) homeostasis
  are interconnected with each other. Moreover, OAs are involved in recruiting of
  many plantgrowth-promoting bacteria that are able to secrete both OAs and phosphatases
  to increase Pi availability and decrease Al toxicity. In this review paper, we summarize
  these mutual mechanisms by which plants deal with both Al toxicity and P starvation,
  with emphasis on OA secretion regulation, plant-growth-promoting bacteria, transcription
  factors, transporters, hormones, and cell wall-related kinases in the context of
  root development and root system architecture remodeling that plays a determinant
  role in improving P use efficiency and Al resistance on acidic soils.
