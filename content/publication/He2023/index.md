abstract: Formate dehydrogenase (FDH; EC 1.2.1.2.) has been implicated in plant responses to a variety of stresses, including aluminum (Al) stress in acidic soils. However, the role of this enzyme in Al tolerance is not yet fully understood, and how FDH gene expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SlFDH gene.
