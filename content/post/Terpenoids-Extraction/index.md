# <font color=green>Step2</font>

Cut <font color=plum>a leaflet</font> from the next to youngest leaf of 3-week-old plant and immerse it in extraction solution, then gently rocked for 1 min. After that, the extract was transferred to a new glass vial for GC/MS analysis.

GC-MS was performed to analyze the profile of volatile compounds using a 7890B network GC system with 5977B inert plus MSD detector(Agilent Technologies, https://www.agilent.com/). Quantified using a standard curve of *γ*-terpinene as the external standard.
