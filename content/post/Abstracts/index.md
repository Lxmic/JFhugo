Cuticle: a hydrophobic boundary layer that coats the outer face of the epidermis of aerial plant organs.

Suberin: a hydrophobic polyester deposited in the apoplast of endodermal and peridermal cells, abscission zones, scar tissues, and seed coats.

Cutin: a polyester network of predominantly fatty acids that constitutes a major component of the plant cuticle.

Cross-link: a lateral covalent linkage between two polymer chains.

Long-chain fatty acid: a fatty acid that is 16 or 18 carbons in length.

Depolymerization: the breakdown of a polymer into its constituent monomers.

Gas chromatography: an analytical technique to separate and quantify the abundance of compounds that are volatile in a gaseous phase.

Apoplast: the continuous region throughout the plant that is external to the plasma membranes.

Dendrimer: a branching, tree-like structure with a single origin and many termini.


Monoacylglycerol: a molecule consisting of glycerol ester-linked to a single acyl chain.

Magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR): a method of solid-state NMR spectroscopy that gives improved peak resolution.

Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (LACS) proteins: enzymes that conjugate a molecule of coenzyme A to the carboxyl end of a fatty acid.

Cytochrome P450: a large family of enzymes that typically perform oxidation reactions.

Cutinase: an enzyme that hydrolyzes polymeric cutin polymers, breaking the ester linkages.

Epidermal-growth-control theory: the thory that turgor-driven organ growth is constrained by the rigid epidermal layer.
