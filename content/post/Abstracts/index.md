<font color=amber>Cuticle</font>: a hydrophobic boundary layer that coats the outer face of the epidermis of aerial plant organs.

<font color=tomato>Suberin</font>: a hydrophobic polyester deposited in the apoplast of endodermal and peridermal cells, abscission zones, scar tissues, and seed coats.

<font color=chocolate>Cutin</font>: a polyester network of predominantly fatty acids that constitutes a major component of the plant cuticle.

<font color=red>Cross-link</font>: a lateral covalent linkage between two polymer chains.

<font color=seagreen>Long-chain fatty acid</font>: a fatty acid that is 16 or 18 carbons in length.

<font color=red>Depolymerization</font>: the breakdown of a polymer into its constituent monomers.

<font color=green>Gas chromatography</font>: an analytical technique to separate and quantify the abundance of compounds that are volatile in a gaseous phase.

<font color=royalblue>Apoplast</font>: the continuous region throughout the plant that is external to the plasma membranes.

<font color=royalblue>Dendrimer</font>: a branching, tree-like structure with a single origin and many termini.


<font color=chocolate>Monoacylglycerol</font>: a molecule consisting of glycerol ester-linked to a single acyl chain.

<font color=yellowgreen>Magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR)</font>: a method of solid-state NMR spectroscopy that gives improved peak resolution.

<font color=chocolate>Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (LACS) proteins</font>: enzymes that conjugate a molecule of coenzyme A to the carboxyl end of a fatty acid.

<font color=purple>Cytochrome P450</font>: a large family of enzymes that typically perform oxidation reactions.

<font color=green>Cutinase</font>: an enzyme that hydrolyzes polymeric cutin polymers, breaking the ester linkages.

<font color=purple>Epidermal-growth-control theory</font>: the thory that turgor-driven organ growth is constrained by the rigid epidermal layer.
